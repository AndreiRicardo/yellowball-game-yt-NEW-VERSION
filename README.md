# A New Version

I propose in this repository to develop a platform game in the Mario Bros style using the knowledge taught by Filipe Alves. I hope you like it and can share that knowledge. I recommend that you watch Filipe's tutorial.
A big hug to everyone.

### What will be done then?

- Reshape the screen to a size in the 16: 9 format that can contemplate screens on any device that runs Html, Javascript and CSS.
- Adapt the information in the HUD for the project.
- Allow the character to move around the scene.
- The camera accompanies the character when he is close to the end of the scene and stops moving when he is drawn away from the end of the screen in both directions.
- For the time being the mechanics of counting life and damage to enemies are maintained.
Each step of the project will be done with a tutorial guide explaining what was done.
I hope you enjoy this material well.
A big hug to everyone.

# Yellowball Runner

A game implemented for didactic purposes on a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3r8up9cz3w&list=PL1EkVGo1AQ0Hsqhvjm4khfp6innDjpj9J), available only in portuguese.
Feel free to use it and share as you wish but it would be cool if you give me due credits :)

### Note
This was implemented when I was graduating and this code is messy. I did not refactor it for being consistent with the videos.
