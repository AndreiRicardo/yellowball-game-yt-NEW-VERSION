# A New Version

I propose in this repository to develop a platform game in the Mario Bros style using the knowledge taught by Filipe Alves. I hope you like it and can share that knowledge. I recommend that you watch Filipe's tutorial.
A big hug to everyone.

# Yellowball Runner

A game implemented for didactic purposes on a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3r8up9cz3w&list=PL1EkVGo1AQ0Hsqhvjm4khfp6innDjpj9J), available only in portuguese.
Feel free to use it and share as you wish but it would be cool if you give me due credits :)

### Note
This was implemented when I was graduating and this code is messy. I did not refactor it for being consistent with the videos.
